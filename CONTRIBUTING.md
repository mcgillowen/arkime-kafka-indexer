## How to contribute to Arkime Kafka Indexer

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in the indexer, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/mcgillowen/arkime-kafka-indexer/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mcgillowen/arkime-kafka-indexer/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mcgillowen/arkime-kafka-indexer/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please make sure that all pre-existing tests and linters pass, and that the fix is covered by a new test if possible.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in an issue with the label `enhancement` and start writing code and submit a PR that implements it.

* We wil then test this change on a production environment to see if the change doesn't introduce any regressions or slowdowns in the processing of the Kafka messages.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the indexer in the [Discussions](https://github.com/mcgillowen/arkime-kafka-indexer/discussions) tab.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
